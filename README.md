# 🚲 Smart Bicycle System  
**A Smart Campus Mobility Platform with QR/NFC Authentication, Real-Time Ride Tracking & MySQL–Python Backend**

This project introduces a smart bicycle-sharing system for university campuses, where users can unlock, ride, and return bicycles using digital authentication integrated with campus identity. Designed to reduce daily travel time, increase convenience, and promote sustainable mobility, the platform supports fleet management, ride analytics, and modular system expansion.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Large campuses require students to walk 4–6 km daily between departments, hostels, labs, and academic blocks, causing:

- Loss of time
- Fatigue and reduced focus
- Unorganized personal bicycle usage
- No accountability or tracking

This project offers a **digital, managed, and scalable solution** to replace manual bicycle usage.
